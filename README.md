# Vectra-Assignment
This assignment combines geometry and visualization tasks: computing polygon properties using vector math, tiling a rectangular room with minimal squares in a spiral pattern, and building a pyramid of alternating upright and inverted equilateral triangles. Each problem emphasizes optimization, structure, and clear plotting.
